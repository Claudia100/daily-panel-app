This is a project that turns https://DailyPanel.org into a user-friendly Android application.  The goal of this app is to help and dignify those who are learning to read English. 
The app is designed to be as simple and easy-to-use as possible, so the user can focus  on what matters most, learning to read English.

 1. JSON feeds which pull individual panels and titles from the Daily Panel website into the Main Activity.
 2. Text-To-Speech to capture the titles.
 3. About Us Activity page with WebViews to capture screen information on the website.
