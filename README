#  Daily Panel Android App

## Synopsis

Name:   Daily Panel Android App

This is a project that turns https://DailyPanel.org into a user-friendly Android application.

The app is designed to be as simple and easy-to-use as possible, so the user can focus  on what matters most, learning to read English.
